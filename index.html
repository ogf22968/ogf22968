	<H2> <i> Places! </i> </H2>
	<p style="font-family:courier;"> I love to travel! I have been to many places throughout the past nineteen years! From Africa, to China to Europe, my family loves to travel. Overall, My favorite place I have ever been has been Africa. There is simply no other place like it! One of the best parts about Africa is the culture. The people are friendly. The food is delicious and the scenery is breathtaking. In Africa, I stayed at The LeWa Wildlife Conservancy, which was one of the most amazing places I have ever been. <p style="font-family:courier;"> <p style="font-family:courier;"> One of my favorite quotes from a guest at LeWa is <q style="font-family:courier;"> Thank you so much for giving us memories we will never forget.  The backdrop, the food, the service, the drives, the animals and the birds were all spectacular. </q></p> <p style="font-family:courier;"> <a href="https://www.lewa.org">here</a> If an oppurtunity ever presents itself for me to go back to Africa, I will be there as soon as possible! </p>
    <H2> <i> School! </i> </H2>
	<p style="font-family:courier;"> School is also one of my favorite things! I am lucky enough to attend The University of Georgia. Athens is such a fun place. I take so many great classes and learn so many amazing things. From Chinese, to Accounting, to Computer Science and even more, I am always amazed by the information I am learning. I have taken Chinese for about six years now. Accounting is probably one of the hardest classes I've taken at The University of Georgia so far. But overall, the teachers are amazing and I love to learn. </p>

	<p style="font-family:courier;"> I have been lucky enough to make a lot of friends at The University of Georgia. Overall, my friends are very silly and fun. Last year, my roommate was a from Dallas, TX. We became very close throughout the year and are still best friends. This year, I live with two girls. One of my roommates, rebecca, is from Atlanta, GA. My other roommate, Kate, is from Dallas, TX. All three of us are very good friends. Having roommates is a lot of fun! </p>
